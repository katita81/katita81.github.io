Password Generator

This program generates a secure password which length is chosen by the user having 8 characters as minimum
and 129 as maximum. Then the user is asked whether he wants to include special characters and/or numeric character,
and/or upper case characters. Given he doesnt choose any of the former criteria. The program generates a password
of only lower case letters. Otherwise the password also includes the chosen type of characters indicated by the user.
Finally the final password is displayed.
